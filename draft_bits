%%
Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is a major concern for food security and insect disease-vector control as 
these compounds are widely used in agriculture, and are used in almost all insecticide-treated bed-nets.
%
Pyrethroids target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), but substitutions in the amino acid sequence can disrupt the activity of these insecticides, 
inducing a resistance phenotype.
% 
To provide a comprehensive account of genetic variation in the Vgsc gene from natural insect populations, 
we use whole-genome sequence data of mosquito populations from eight African countries (Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project).
%
We describe 20 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions at appreciable frequency in one or more populations that are previously unknown in Anopheles mosquitoes.
% 
Haplotype estimation revealed thirteen of these alleles occurred almost exclusively on haplotypes carrying the known L995F resistance allele (L1014F Musca domesticus), 
and may enhance or compensate for the L995F resistance phenotype.
%
A novel mutation I1527T, adjacent to a predicted pyrethroid binding site, was found in tight linkage with alleles causing a V402L substitution, 
similar to a combination found to cause resistance in several other insect species.
% 
We analyse the genetic backgrounds on which non-synonymous alleles are found and describe twelve distinct haplotype groups with evidence of recent positive selection, 
providing new information about the geographical distribution and spread of resistance.
%
Finally we demonstrate methods that can identify markers suitable to design high-throughput, low-cost genetic assays for improved surveillance of pyrethroid resistance in the field.
%
Our results demonstrate that the molecular basis of target-site pyrethroid resistance is more complex than hitherto appreciated, 
and provide a foundation for the development of new tools to track the spread insecticide resistance.
%
With high conservation found across insect Vgsc, including independently evolving pyrethroid resistance via the same SNP mutations,
our methodology and findings should be easily and effectively applied across pest insect systems.

Since their discovery in the mid-1970s, synthetic pyrethroid insecticides have played an important role in pest insect management.

Compared to naturally occurring pyrethroids, they are many times more insecticidally active and much less toxic to mammals (Casida 2010; Soderland 2014).
%
Pyrethroids have been the cornerstone of malaria prevention in Africa for almost two decades \cite{Bhatt2015} and they are currently used in all insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs)
%
Resistance to this class of insecticide is now widespread in malaria vector populations across Africa \cite{Hemingway2016}.
%
There are fears that increasing resistance will result in control failure and reversal of large reductions in mortality and morbidity (@@numbers? e.g Bhatt).
%
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published plans for insecticide resistance management (IRM), 
which emphasise the need for improvements in both our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of resistance and our ability to monitor them in natural populations \cite{WorldHealthOrganization2012}.
%
Pyrethroids are also widely used in food security to protect crops from insects (Field et al, 2017). I
%
It has been estimated that up to 40% of agricultural yields are lost to insect pests and diseases annually (EU, 2015),
a value that could double without effective insecticides (ECPA, 2016).
%
With the massive growth in human population predicted to continue, the pressure on sustainable food production will only increase.
% 
Few, safe insecticidal chemical families mean limited insecticide rotation options, 
a better understanding and ability to track of insecticide resistance in natural populations will therefore be necessary to inform optimal control strategies.

The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is the physiological target of pyrethroid insecticides, and is integral to the insect nervous system.
%
Pyrethroid molecules bind to sites within the protein channel and prevent normal nervous system function, causing paralysis (``knock-down'') and then death.
%
However, amino acid substitutions at key positions within the protein alter the interaction with insecticide molecules (target-site resistance), 
increasing the dose of insecticide required for knock-down \cite{Davies2007a,Dong2014}.
%
In the African malaria vectors \textit{Anopheles gambiae} and \textit{An. coluzzii}, three substitutions have been found to cause pyrethroid resistance.
%
Two of these substitutions occur in codon 995, with \texttt{L995F} prevalent in West and Central Africa \cite{Martinez-Torres1998,Silva2014}, 
and \texttt{L995S} found in Central and East Africa \cite{Ranson2000,Silva2014}.
%
Codon numbering is given here relative to transcript \texttt{AGAP004707-RA} as defined in the AgamP4.4 gene annotations.
%
A mapping of codon numbers from \texttt{AGAP004707-RA} to \emph{Musca domestica}, the system in which knock-down resistance mutations were first described \cite{Williamson1996}, 
is given in Table \ref{table:variants_missense}.
%
A third substitution, \texttt{N1570Y}, has been found in West and Central Africa and shown to increase resistance in association with \texttt{L995F} \cite{Jones2012}.
%
However, studies in other insect species have found a variety of other \emph{Vgsc} substitutions inducing a resistance phenotype \cite{Davies2007b,Rinkevich2013,Dong2014}.
%
To our knowledge, no studies have used \emph{Vgsc} haplotype data from natural insect populations,
 thus the molecular basis of target-site resistance to pyrethroids has not been fully explored.
%%


%%
Basic information is also lacking about the spread of pyrethroid resistance.
%
For example, it is not clear when, where or how many times pyrethroid target-site resistance has emerged in any insect system.
%
Geographical paths of transmission, carrying resistance alleles between populations, are also not known.
%
Previous studies have found evidence that in Anopheles mosquitoes, \texttt{L995F} occurs on several different genetic backgrounds suggesting multiple independent outbreaks of resistance driven by this allele \cite{Pinto2007,Etang2009,Lynd2010,Santolamazza2015}.
%
However, these studies analysed only small gene regions in a limited number of mosquito populations, 
and therefore had limited resolution to make inferences about relationships between haplotypes carrying this allele.
%
It has also been shown that the \texttt{L995F} allele spread from \textit{An. gambiae} to \textit{An. coluzzii} in West Africa \cite{Clarkson2014,Norris2015}.
%
However, both \texttt{L995F} and \texttt{L995S} now have wide geographical distributions \cite{Silva2014}, 
and to our knowledge no attempts have been made to infer or track the geographical spread of either allele.

Here we report an in-depth analysis of genetic variation in the \textit{Vgsc} gene, 
using whole-genome Illumina sequence data from phase 1 of the \emph{Anopheles gambiae} 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G) \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}.
%
The Ag1000G phase 1 resource includes data on nucleotide variation in 765 wild-caught mosquitoes sampled from 8 countries, 
with representation of West, Central, Southern and East Africa, and of both \textit{An. gambiae} and \textit{An. coluzzii}.
%
We investigate variation across the complete gene coding sequence, and report population genetic data for both known and novel non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions.
%
We then use haplotype data from the chromosomal region spanning the \textit{Vgsc} gene to study the genetic backgrounds carrying resistance alleles, 
infer the geographical spread of resistance between mosquito populations, and provide evidence for recent positive selection.
%
Finally, we explore ways in which variation data from Ag1000G can be used to design high-throughput, 
low-cost genetic assays for surveillance of pyrethroid resistance, with the capability to differentiate and track resistance outbreaks.
