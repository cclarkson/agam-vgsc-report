%%
Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is a major concern for malaria vector control, because these are the compounds used in almost all insecticide-treated bed-nets.
%
Pyrethroids target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), but substitutions in the amino acid sequence can disrupt the activity of these insecticides, inducing a resistance phenotype.
%
Here we use whole-genome sequence data from phase 1 of the \emph{Anopheles gambiae} 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G) to provide a comprehensive account of genetic variation in the \emph{Vgsc} gene in mosquito populations from eight African countries.
%
We describe 20 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions at appreciable frequency in one or more populations that are previously unknown in \emph{Anopheles} mosquitoes.
%
Thirteen of these novel alleles were found to occur almost exclusively on haplotypes carrying the known \texttt{L995F} resistance allele (\texttt{L1014F} in \emph{Musca domesticus} codon numbering), and may enhance or compensate for the \texttt{L995F} resistance phenotype.
%
A novel mutation \texttt{I1527T}, adjacent to a predicted pyrethroid binding site, was found in tight linkage with alleles causing a \texttt{V402L} substitution, similar to a combination found to cause resistance in several other insect species.
%
We analyse the genetic backgrounds on which non-synonymous alleles are found and describe twelve distinct haplotype groups with evidence of recent positive selection.
%
Five of these groups comprise haplotypes from different countries, in one case separated by over 3000 km, providing new information about the geographical distribution and spread of resistance.
%
We also find evidence for multiple introgression events transmitting resistance alleles between \emph{An. gambiae} and \emph{An. coluzzii}.
%
We identify markers that could be used to design high-throughput, low-cost genetic assays for improved surveillance of pyrethroid resistance in the field.
%
Our results demonstrate that the molecular basis of target-site pyrethroid resistance is more complex than previously appreciated, and provide a foundation for the development of new tools to track the spread insecticide resistance.
